# Sizzle

Sizzle is a platformer in which the player can't touch a spot on the ground for more than a short period of time or else the player dies (takes damage?)

## Features / Notes 
- Previously landed-on tiles have a cooldown time longer than the touch-time to prevent going back and forth
- Player movement
  - Left / right
  - Jump
- Player special moves
  - Double-jump
  - Jump slash
  - Wall-jump
  - Wall-slide (warms up wall tiles just like standing on the ground)
  - Heat-up (warms up tiles even more)
- Obstacles
  - Pit spikes
  - Wall spikes

## Interesting ideas
- Player can press a button to be dropped in from ceiling
	- Game becomes about clearing blocks rather than traversal
- Destroyed tiles regrow over time
- High score based on fewest jumps to reach finish
- Music voices change volume based on player activity (e.g. melody horns as player starts running)
- Vertical scroll
